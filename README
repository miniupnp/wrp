WRP is a HTTP proxy service that renders the web page in to a GIF/JPEG image associated with clickable imagemap of the original web links. It allows to use historical and obsolete web browsers on the modern web. It's still a work in progress but it's quite stable and usable for casual web browsing.

WRP supports Mac OS X, Linux and FreeBSD. It requires Python 2.7 and PyQT4 under Linux or FreeBSD.
